# Webpage project construction company

This project is the main webpage, contacting service, and job-management system i am creating for my uncle's construction company. this started out as a college project, but when i've got some more time on my hands, i want to continue working on it, and hopefully deliver a fully working product. the core appointment making system works, i just need to visually work out the front end, and add the last few extra features, like a slideshow/gallery to show of previous completed projects, a way to upload pictures, a way to disable the online form when booked full, and a secure login system.
